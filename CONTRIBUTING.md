# Contributing guidelines

## How to become a contributor and submit your own code

### Contributor License Agreements

We'd love to accept your patches! Before we can take them, we have to jump a couple of legal hurdles.

After you will submit PR automatic bot will check CLA status, you will be asked to sign one if you didn't sign it before.

### Contributing A Patch

1. Fork the desired repo, develop and test your code changes.
1. Verify that your code changes follows our [guidelines](docs/devel/guidelines.md)
1. Submit a pull request.

### Adding dependencies

If your patch depends on new packages, add that package with [`glide`](https://glide.sh/).
