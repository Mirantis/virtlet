# Virtlet image server and pod example

In order to try out the example, do the following on a cluster that
has nodes with Virtlet on it (see [the instructions](../deploy/README.md) in
`deploy/` directory):

1. Create image server Deployment and Service:
```
kubectl create -f image-server.yaml -f image-service.yaml
```
2. Wait for image-server pod to become `Running`:
```
kubectl get pods -w
```
3. Create a sample VM:
```
kubectl create -f cirros-vm.yaml
```
4. Wait for `cirros-vm` pod to become `Running`:
```
kubectl get pods -w
```
5. List libvirt domains:
```
./virsh.sh list
```
6. Connect to the VM console:
```
./virsh.sh console @cirros-vm
```
7. As soon as the VM has booted, you can use the `vmssh.sh` script to access it using ssh:
```
./vmssh.sh cirros@cirros-vm [command...]
```

Besides [cirros-vm.yaml](cirros-vm.yaml), there's also [ubuntu-vm.yaml](ubuntu-vm.yaml) that can be used to start an Ubuntu Xenial VM. It can also be accessed using `vmssh.sh` after it boots:
```
./vmssh.sh root@ubuntu-vm [command...]
```

# Kubernetes on VM-based StatefulSet

[Another example](k8s.yaml) involves starting several VMs using `StatefulSet` and deploying
Kubernetes using `kubeadm` on it.

You can create the cluster like this:
```
kubectl create -f k8s.yaml
```

Watch progress of the cluster setup via the VM console:
```
./virsh.sh list
./virsh.sh console @k8s-0
```

After it's complete you can log into the master node:

```
./vmssh.sh k8s-0
```

There you can wait a bit for k8s nodes and pods to become ready.
You can list them using the following commands inside the VM:

```
kubectl get nodes -w
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o wide -w
```

After that you can follow
[the instructions](../deploy/real-cluster.md) to install Virtlet on
the cluster, but note that you'll have to disable KVM because nested
virtualization is not yet supported by Virtlet.
