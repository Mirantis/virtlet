# Overview

The following figure provides a general view of Virtlet architecture:

![Virtlet Architecture](virtlet.png)

Virtlet consists of the following components:

* [Virtlet manager](../cmd/virtlet) - implements CRI interface for virtualization and image handling
* [libvirt](http://libvirt.org) instance
* [tapmanager](../pkg/tapmanager) which is responsible for managing VM networking
* [vmwrapper](../cmd/vmwrapper) which is responsible for setting up the environment for emulator
* emulator, currently [qemu](http://www.qemu-project.org/) with KVM support (with possibility to disable KVM)

In addition to the above, our example setup includes
[CRI proxy](../cmd/criproxy) which provides the possibility to mix
docker-shim and VM based workloads on the same k8s node.

## Virtlet manager

The main binary is responsible for providing API fullfiling
[CRI specification](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/container-runtime-interface-v1.md).
It serves the requests from kubelet by doing the following:

* setting up libvirt VM environment (virtual drives, network
  interfaces, trimming resources like RAM, CPU)
* requesting CNI setup from tapmanager (see below)
* telling libvirt to call vmwrapper instead of using emulator directly
* querying libvirt for VM statuses
* instructing libvirt to stop VMs
* requesting CNI teardown from tapmanager (see below)
* and finally calling libvirt to tear down VM environment.

## tapmanager

`tapmanger` is a process that controls the setup of VM networking
using CNI which is started by `virtlet` command (it uses the same
`virtlet` binary). It has the following responsibilities:
* takes setup requests from Virtlet manager and sets up networking
  for a VM, producing an open fd corresponding to the tap device
* runs DHCP server for each active VM
* serves requests from `vmwrapper` (see below) sending it the file
  descriptor over a Unix domain socket so that it can be used in
  another container (more precisely, another mount namespace) without
  the need for shared access to the directory containing network
  namespaces
* tears down the VM network upon Virtlet manager requests

## vmwrapper

`vmrapper` is run by libvirt and wraps the emulator (QEMU/KVM).  It
requests tap file descriptor from `tapmanager`, adds command line
arguments needed by the emulator to use the tap device and then
`exec`s the emulator.

## CRI Proxy

CRI Proxy provides a way to run multiple CRI implementations on the
same node, e.g. Virtlet and docker-shim. This is handy for running
infrastructure pods such as kube-proxy. CRI Proxy reuses docker-shim
component from kubelet to make it possible to have Docker as one of
CRI implementations on the multi-runtime nodes.
See [CRI Proxy design document](criproxy.md) for more detailed
description.
