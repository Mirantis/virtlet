# VM Logging
Virtlet runs many VMs on Kubernetes and each of them writes something to `stdout` and `stderr`. User
is given two options:

1. redirect `stdout`/`stderr` into unix socket (DEFAULT)
2. redirect `stdout`/`stderr` into pty console

## Redirecting stdout and stderr into unix socket
By default VM logs are sent into unix socket:
```
/var/lib/libvirt/streamer.sock
```
This option is enabled by default. If you want to disable set `disable_logging` to true in virtlet-config configmap.

### Architecture
Following image illustrates how logging is handled. There is one directory on host needed:

* **/var/log/pods** (predefined by Kubernetes) is where Kubernetes expects JSON formatted logs to appear.

NOTE: It is important to configure volume mount for `mirantis/virtlet`.

Kubernetes is not able to find and understand raw log files that contain direct dumps from VM. Therefore
we run a worker which is reformatting VM logs into a special JSON format that is understood
by Kubernetes.

Provided that redirecting `stdout` and `stderr` to unix socket is turned on(DEFAULT)
user should be able to see logs on Kubernetes Dashboard:

Obtaining logs from CLI should also work:

```bash
$ kubectl logs cirros-vm
...
=== datasource: nocloud local ===
instance-id: cirros-vm-001
name: N/A
availability-zone: N/A
local-hostname: cirros-vm
launch-index: N/A
=== cirros: current=0.3.5 uptime=1.75 ===
  ____               ____  ____
 / __/ __ ____ ____ / __ / __/
   http://cirros-cloud.net


login as 'cirros' user. default password: 'cubswin:)'. use 'sudo' for root.
```

### Limitations
There are some limitations when redirecting logs into files is enabled:

- Command `virsh console <vm>` no longer works since libvirt serial port type is 'unix' and not 'pty'.

## Redirecting stdout and stderr into pty
In some cases it may be desired to enable `virsh console <VM>` command that is disabled in case when
redirecting everything into files is enabled (see **Limitations** above). Just set `disable_logging` to true in virtlet-config configmap.


### Limitations
There are some limitations when redirecting logs into files is disabled:

- command `kubectl logs <MY-POD>` will not work
- command `kubectl attach <MY-POD>` will not work as it uses the same unix socket connection
- Kubernetes Dashboard will not display any logs for Virtlet pods
