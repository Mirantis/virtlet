* Added the `ConfigDrive` support as a second type of the `cloud-init`
  ISO9660-based datasources. You can now choose either the `nocloud` or
  `configdrive` value for the `VirtletCloudInitImageType` annotation. If this
  annotation is not set, Virtlet defaults to `nocloud`.

* Added the possibility to pass MTU for a network device through
  both supported ways to configure such interface: DHCP and cloud-init.
