# Q4'17-10-18

* Implemented the `kubectl port-forward` command support to Virtlet.
  The command allows you to forward one or more local ports to a pod.
* Added `VirtletCloudInitUserDataSource` annotation that is used
  to create user-data from either ConfigMap or Secret.
  The syntax for the key is `[configmap|secret]/name`.
* Added `VirtletSSHKeySource` that can be used to include SSH keys
  from ConfigMap or Secret.
  The syntax for the key is `[configmap|secret]/name[/key]`.
  If the `key` part is omitted, `authorized_keys` is used.
* Added a helper function to recursively merge arbitrary JSON-like
  data.
* Moved common Kubernetes-client related code to the `utils` package.
