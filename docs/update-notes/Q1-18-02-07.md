* Reworked VM image handling. Virtlet does not make copies of the QCOW2 image
  files that it downloads during a VM setup anymore. Instead, it uses
  the images as backing files for the root volumes. This improves performance
  for large images, reduces disk space usage, and helps avoiding
  container creation errors on slower systems.
* Made e2e tests compatible with the Ubuntu 16.04 cloud image.
* Added the `-junitOutput` flag for e2e tests.
* Updated the CNI plugins to run in the host mount namespace.
* Fixed DHCP route handling for multiple CNIs.
* Fixed crashing upon the CNI configuration load error.
