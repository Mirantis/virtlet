# Image Handling

Virtlet supports QCOW2 format for VM images.

## Options:
- `ImagePullSecrets` - not supported currently
- Protocol to use to download the image. By default `https` is used. In order to use `http` set `VIRTLET_DOWNLOAD_PROTOCOL` env var to `http` for virtlet container.

## An example of container definition:

```yaml
  containers:
    - name: test-vm
      image: download.cirros-cloud.net/0.3.4/cirros-0.3.4-x86_64-disk.img
```

**Note:** You need to specify url without `scheme://`. In case you are using [instructions](../deploy/README.md) in `deploy/` directory to deploy Virtlet, you need to add `virtlet/` prefix to the url.

Also see [Image Name Translation](image-name-translation.md) for another way of providing image URL.

## Image handling Workflow:
1. Kubelet sends `PullImage` gRPC request to Virtlet.
(Note, that `PullImage` request can be skipped by kubelet unless the pod has `imagePullPolicy: PullAlways` or `imagePullPolicy: PullIfNotPreset` and the image is not pulled yet.)
1. Virtlet uses image url fragment after last slash as internal image name that it looks up in the list of existent images on the host.
1. The image will be downloaded using specified url prepended with `scheme://`. After that Virtlet creates libvirt volume in "**default**" libvirt pool under `/var/lib/libvirt/images` and copies the image content to it. As there is no versioning of QCOW2 images Virtlet downloads the image each time, using the image name with `scheme://` prefix added.

**Note:** Virtual machines are started from volumes which are clones of boot images.
Original images are stored in libvirt `default` pool (`/var/lib/libvirt/images` on filesystem).
Clones used as boot images are stored in "**volumes**" libvirt pool under `/var/lib/virtlet/volumes`
during the VM execution time and are automatically garbage collected by Virtlet
after stopping VM pod environment (sandbox).

## Restrictions and pitfalls

Image name are a subject to the strict validation rules that normally applied to the docker image names. Thus one cannot
just put arbitrary URL into the image name. In particular, image names cannot have capital letters, colons and some other
characters that are commonly found in the URLs. Using image name with invalid characters is a common reason for VM
creation failure with non-obvious error status.

In order to overcome these limitations, virtlet provides alternate technology called `Image name translation` that allows
to use alias name for the image and define how this alias translates into the URL along with additional transport options
elsewhere. See [Image Name Translation](image-name-translation.md) document for details.
