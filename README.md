# virtlet [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Mirantis/virtlet.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Mirantis/virtlet)

Virtlet is a Kubernetes runtime server which allows you to run VM workloads, based on QCOW2 images.

At this stage (pre-alpha), it's possible to run Virtlet by following the instructions from either [Running local environment](docs/devel/running-local-environment.md) or [Deploy using DaemonSets](deploy/README.md) documents. There's also [separate document](deploy/real-cluster.md) describing the process of installing Virtlet on real clusters.

[See here](docs/architecture.md) for the description of Virtlet architecture.

## Community

You can join
[#virtlet](https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/virtlet/) channel on
[Kubernetes Slack](https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages)
(register at [slack.k8s.io](http://slack.k8s.io) if you're not in k8s group already). Both the
users and developers are welcome!

## Getting started with Virtlet

To try out Virtlet follow the instructions from [Running local environment](docs/devel/running-local-environment.md) and [try out examples](examples/README.md) documents.

### Virtlet introduction video

You can watch and listen to Virtlet introduction and description video that was recorded on Kubernetes Community Meeting [here](https://youtu.be/x5uBq-ugoio?t=38).

### Virtlet usage demo

You can watch sample usage session under [this](https://asciinema.org/a/1a6xp5j4o22rnsx9wpvumd4kt) link.

You can also give Virtlet a quick try using our demo script (requires Docker 1.12+):
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mirantis/virtlet/master/deploy/demo.sh
chmod +x demo.sh
# './demo.sh --help' displays the description
./demo.sh
```

The demo will start a test cluster, deploy Virtlet on it and then boot a [CirrOS](https://launchpad.net/cirros) VM there. You may access sample nginx server via `curl http://nginx.default.svc.cluster.local` from inside the VM. To disconnect from VM, press `Ctrl-D`. After the VM has booted, you can also use a helper script to connect to its SSH server:
```
examples/vmssh.sh cirros@cirros-vm [command...]
```

By default, CNI bridge plugin is used for cluster networking. It's also possible to override this with `flannel` or `weave` plugin, e.g.:
```
CNI_PLUGIN=flannel ./demo.sh
```

The demo script will check for KVM support on the host and will make Virtlet use KVM if it's available on Docker host. If KVM is not available, plain QEMU will be used.

The demo is based on [kubeadm-dind-cluster](https://github.com/Mirantis/kubeadm-dind-cluster) project. **Docker btrfs storage driver is currently unsupported.** Please refer to `kubeadm-dind-cluster` documentation for more info.

You can remove the test cluster with `./dind-cluster-v1.6.sh clean` when you no longer need it.

## External projects using Virtlet
Even if Virtlet is in pre-alpha stage at this point, we have some external projects using it already.
One interesting usecase is that of [MIKELANGELO project](https://www.mikelangelo-project.eu/) that
runs [OSv unikernels](http://osv.io) on Kubernetes using Virtlet. Unikernels are special case of VMs
that are extremely small in size (20MB or so) and can only run a single process each. Nevertheless,
Virtlet has no problems handling them on Kubernetes as demonstrated in this
[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-QrxDJSZBA). Microservice Demo is available
[here](https://github.com/mikelangelo-project/osv-microservice-demo#deploying-unikernels-on-kubernetes).
