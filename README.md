# virtlet [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Mirantis/virtlet.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Mirantis/virtlet)

Virtlet is a Kubernetes runtime server which allows you to run VM workloads, based on QCOW2 images.

At this stage (pre-alpha), it's possible to run Virtlet by following the instructions from either [Running local environment](docs/devel/running-local-environment.md) or [Deploy using DaemonSets](deploy/README.md) documents.

[See here](docs/architecture.md) for the description of Virtlet architecture.

## Getting started with Virtlet

To try out Virtlet follow the instructions from [Running local environment](docs/devel/running-local-environment.md) and [try out examples](examples/README.md) documents.

### Virtlet introduction video

You can watch and listen to Virtlet introduction and description video that was recorded on Kubernetes Community Meeting [here](https://youtu.be/x5uBq-ugoio?t=38).

### Virtlet usage demo

You can watch sample usage session under [this](https://asciinema.org/a/1a6xp5j4o22rnsx9wpvumd4kt) link.

You can also give Virtlet a quick try using our demo script (requires Docker 1.12+):
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mirantis/virtlet/master/deploy/demo.sh
chmod +x demo.sh
# './demo.sh --help' displays the description
./demo.sh
```

The demo will start a test cluster, deploy Virtlet on it and then boot a [CirrOS](https://launchpad.net/cirros) VM there. You may access sample nginx server via `curl http://nginx.default.svc.cluster.local` from inside the VM. To detach from VM console, press `Ctrl-]`. After you detach from the VM you can remove the test cluster with `./dind-cluster-v1.5.sh clean`.

By default, CNI bridge plugin is used for cluster networking. Another option is using [flannel](https://github.com/coreos/flannel). To do so, run demo script like this:
```
CNI_PLUGIN=flannel ./demo.sh
```

The demo script will check for KVM support on the host and will make Virtlet use KVM if it's available on Docker host. If KVM is not available, plain QEMU will be used.

The demo is based on [kubeadm-dind-cluster](https://github.com/Mirantis/kubeadm-dind-cluster) project. **Docker btrfs storage driver is currently unsupported.** Please refer to `kubeadm-dind-cluster` documentation for more info.
